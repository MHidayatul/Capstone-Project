## Overview
OptiLens is a mobile app designed for the early detection and classification of cataracts through image processing. It addresses the global issue of visual impairment caused by cataracts, particularly in underserved areas with limited access to ophthalmological resources.

The app features two main functions:

1.Automated Cataract Classification: Using advanced image processing algorithms, OptiLens identifies the severity of cataracts, providing immediate insights into users' conditions.
2.Manual Refractive Clarity Assessment: A simple visual test allows users to monitor changes in their vision quality over time, encouraging proactive eye health management.

By combining these tools, OptiLens empowers individuals with a user-friendly self-assessment tool, aiming to enhance accessibility to eye care and reduce the risk of blindness from delayed treatment.
